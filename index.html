<p><strong>Financial assistance will be available for speakers who require it.</strong></p>

<p>Sessions can come in many forms. Presentations are great but also consider proposing panel discussions, questions and answer or tutorials. If you have a good idea, then we encourage it you to submit it!</p>

<p>Submitted talks should fit into a standard time slot of 20 minutes + 5 minutes for discussion or an extended time slot of 40 minutes + 10 minutes for discussion. The Summit organization committee will be responsible for selecting the accepted talks and may decide to reassign an extended talk to standard length or vice versa.</p>

<p class="callout-box"><strong>Deadline for proposal submission is August 19, 2016.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Guidelines Title</strong>: An interesting, clever title can help distinguish your session. This title will be shown on the OpenWrt Summit Schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This is your chance to *sell* your talk to the organizers, so do your best to highlight the problem/contribution/work that you are addressing in your presentation. The technical details are still important, but the relevance of what you are presenting will help the organizers during the selection process.</p>

<p>Abstract tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This will be posted on the conference website so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).</li>
	<li>Sessions and abstracts should be done in English only. We, sadly, do not have translators available.</li>
	<li>Describe the particular audience for your session and what you expect them to gain from it</li>
	<li>Tell us how the content will help better the OpenWrt/LEDE project and community</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Tell us the story of you. Your biography should highlight relevant pieces of your career and life. Attendees will be able to see this so don't hesitate to promote yourself. If you're going to speak, you deserve the recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Panel Discussion</strong>: Make sure to list all of the participants in the panel discussion.</p>
