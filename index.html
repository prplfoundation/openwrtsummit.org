<p>
  <strong>Automatic updates on the Turris routers</strong><br>
  <em>Michael Vaner, CZ.nic</em><br>
  One of the main features of the Turris and the Turris Omnia routers are
automatic updates. The talk highlights the challenges of performing them and
introduces a solution based on multiple years of experience with the
problematic. It also mentions the likely tasks needed to bring the solution to
other routers, both on small scale and large.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Best-practice for NAND-based firmware using UBI</strong><br>
  <em>Daniel Golle</em><br>
  An increasing amount of recent embedded boards come with NAND storage. NAND, however, is inherently unreliable! We need to take care of bad-blocks and diversify write-access by maintaining erase counters. In this session, I'm going to explain best-practise for NAND-based devices in OpenWrt/LEDE.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Boxes in Boxes: virtualisation and containerisation in the context of embedded routers</strong><br>
  <em>Wouter Cloetens and Wojtek Makowski, SoftAtHome</em><br>
  Containers have been hyped as a software deployment strategy on servers in the last few years. This talk will dig into how this translates into deploying modular software updates in the security-senstive, resource-constrained environment of routers deployed in customer premises, using container and/or virtualisation technology.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bringing OpenWrt to market -- experiences from the carrier industry</strong><br>
  <em>Jos Delbar, Technicolor</em><br>
  Technicolor is a leading vendor of customer premises equipment, providing managed gateway and router products to telcos and cable operators throughout the world. Technicolor has adopted OpenWrt as the foundation for a significant subset of these products. In this presentation, we would like to share our experiences with bringing OpenWrt to market, from multiple perspectives including business, operational and technical.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>FCC compliance with open source: Running OpenWrt in a VM on top of the L4Re microhypervisor</strong><br>
  <em>Michael Hohmuth, Kernkonzept</em><br>
  In 2014, the FCC created a rule that ordered Wifi router manufacturers to prevent misconfiguration of, and tampering with, the router's Wifi configuration.  This controversial rule raised many concerns, including with respect to its compatibility with open-source router OSes such as OpenWrt.<br><br>

This environment prompted the prpl Foundation to sponsor a venturesome experiment: What would it take to put OpenWrt into a virtual machine on a typical Wifi-router platform, isolating it from the Wifi driver and configuration to comply with FCC's rules?  The prpl Foundation set out to combine its OpenWrt expertise with its Security engineering subgroup. prpl member Kernkonzept was just about to release its new MIPS port of its L4Re microhypervisor as the first open-source hypervisor for MIPS' new VZ virtualization extensions.  As MIPS has been the dominant architecture for Wifi router devices, this appeared to be a good fit.<br><br>

In this talk, we'll take you along for the ride that ensued.  We'll demonstrate OpenWrt running in a virtual machine on top of the L4Re microhypervisor, and show you that good, the bad, and the ugly.  We will also highlight other use cases for router virtualization besides the FCC's.

  <strong>From Reproducible Debian builds to Reproducible OpenWrt, LEDE &amp; coreboot
</strong><br>
  <em>Holger "h01ger" Levsen and Alexander "lynxis" Couzens, reproducible-builds.org</em><br>
  Reproducible builds enable everyone to verify that a given binary is made from the source it is claimed to be  made from, by enabling anyone to create bit by bit identical binaries.<br><br>

This talk will report on the state of reproducible builds in various  distributions focussing on Debian, OpenWrt, LEDEa and coreboot. Other projects which have efforts on Reproducible Builds and which will be mentioned briefly: Archlinux, F-Droid, Fedora, FreeBSD,  Guix, NetBSD, SuSE, and Qubes OS . As such this presentation shall be interesting and insightful for anyone working on any free  software project.<br><br>

Holger will start with explaining the status of  Reproducible Debian, briefly followed by an overview of  common problems and solutions, followed by a quick explaination of the  shared test infrastructure for reproducible tests of any project. You will learn how the community was broadened, what future plans we have to  address what might be needed beyond being able to reproducible build, so that this becomes truly meaningful for users in practice.<br><br>

Following this, Lynxis will present a more detailed status on the reproducibility of OpenWrt, Lede and coreboot and the work left to be done in these areas.
</p>

  <strong>Industry + Community: are we making progress?</strong><br>
  <em>Kathy Giori, Arduino Srl</em><br>
  Industry and Community developers have different end goals for OpenWrt, but like Linux kernel development, if there is trust behind industry-community collaboration, then both parties benefit. What is the current mood between them? In this panel discussion, developers from both industry and community are invited to share their thoughts about what is going well, and where we can still do better.  This session will invite active audience participation and comments too. Panelists tbd.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>OpenWrt build infrastructures --- past, present and future</strong><br>
  <em>Luka Perkov, Sartura and OpenWrt core team</em><br>
  downloads.openwrt.org works and delivers
pre-assembled images to OpenWrt users without them giving a lot of thought on
how the download area works underneath. My talk will provide a background on
the site's origins, elaborate on how are the images found there being built and
describe the infrastructure which enables users to simply download precompiled
binaries of their favorite Linux distribution and flash it on their routers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Openwrt of Things</strong><br>
  <em>Senthi Kumar</em><br>
  "According to CISCO, there will be 50 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020..”<br>
This session highlights the key prospects of Internet of Things and how OpenWRT is the best platform to act as the operating system for these connected devices. It covers the advantages of using OpenWRT in the connected devices and how it can solve the biggest problems in the industry. Also, a live demo involving connection of OpenWRT to private cloud network to connect the home sensors is included in the session.<br><br>

This session enables the audience to make their hands dirty by building their first openwrt based IoT product.<br><br>

Audience can understand how to interface different sensor with IoT product running on openwrt.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>OpenWrt Project Funding Support from prpl</strong><br>
  <em>Art Swift, prpl Foundation</em><br>
  prpl Foundation began funding OpenWrt projects in the spring of 2016. Art Swift, President of prpl Foundation, explains the goals of the funding program, the process for selecting proposals and the projects funded to date. Art will also discuss the future of the program and describe selected projects of industry interest.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Speeding up WiFi (whilst saving packets)</strong><br>
  <em>Toke Høiland-Jørgensen, make-wifi-fast</em><br>
  OpenWrt has been on the bleeding edge for distributing all the fixes for reducing internet edge latency (a.k. bufferbloat) on a variety of technologies This talk will recap a few of the accomplishments thus far (bql, fq_codel, sqm_scripts, cake), and then quickly move onto discussing the new wifi fq_codel and airtime fairness that has just entered the tree, and why they matter, and what problems remain, in the make-wifi-fast project.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Supporting multiple WAN interfaces in a seamless and transparent way</strong><br>
  <em>Johan Peeters, Technicolor</em><br>
  At last year's summit, Hans Dedecker introduced Technicolor's solution for supporting services across multiple WAN interfaces with an OpenWrt based product. While most OpenWrt users need just one single WAN interface for all broadband traffic, we are confronted with telcos requiring multiple services on the WAN. For example, they might want to separate data, video, voice and management traffic in multiple VLANs.<br><br>

  This year, we'd like to introduce a related challenge: how to support
an OpenWrt based product that can be connected to the Internet via one
of many different types of WAN interfaces like Ethernet, DSL and LTE--
each employing one of many different protocols like PPP and DHCP--in
a manner which is transparent to the rest of the system?<br><br>

OpenWrt does not provide an out of the box solution for this use case
today. In this presentation, we will describe the use cases in more
detail and present our solution which includes new OpenWrt packages
and scripts.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Testing OpenWrt and LEDE with Boardfarm</strong><br>
  <em>Matt McClintock and Eric Schultz, prpl Foundation</em><br>
  Matt McClintock and Eric Schultz will discuss the state of the Boardfarm test framework, give live examples on how to add a board, and create a simple test. They will also discuss how to contribute and how we can further setup a useful test infrastructure for OpenWrt/LEDE devices.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The Serval Mesh Extender: Using OpenWrt to support disaster communications</strong><br>
  <em>Dr. Paul Gardner-Stephen, Flinders University, The Serval Project and TU-Darmstadt</em><br>
  The Serval Project has for the past six years been working to create infrastructure-free mobile telecommunications systems, so that people can communicate anywhere, anytime.  The progressive locking down of mobile operating systems with regard to their ability for form ad-hoc mobile networks (Symbian, early versions of Windows Mobile and Android all supported this capability), has led us to creating a low-cost OpenWRT-based device that allows nearby mobile telephones to form mobile ad-hoc networks.  By incorporating UHF, VHF and/or HF radio modules, these Serval Mesh Extender devices are able to facilitate the formation of mobile ad-hoc networks spanning many kilometres. This talk will discuss the Serval Project, the Serval Mesh Extender, its use of OpenWRT, the challenges ahead, as well as our existing trial activities in the Australian Outback, and more recently, the pilot that we will be running in the South Pacific with the support of Australia's foreign humanitarian aid program, AusAID.  This will include a discussion of the current process we are going through of having designed and manufactured our own custom OpenWRT-based hardware, including a number of design trade-offs that we have had to make for budgetary, and regulatory reasons, in part due to the unique challenges that rapid international humanitarian deployments trigger.
</p>

  <strong>War stories from working with OpenWrt industries</strong><br>
  <em>Davor Popovic, Sartura</em><br>
  As a member of a company specialized in OpenWrt development, Sartura, I have
gained extensive experience in wokring with OpenWrt and the industry
surrounding it. My talk will focus on the good and bas sides of working with
OpenWrt, what to expect from clients and their requierments, and where does
OpenWrt score big points and where are its short-falls. I will also share some
personal OpenWrt war stories which underline some real issues developers face
while meeting delivery deadlines as well as what was done to solve them.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why GPL Enforcement Is Essential to OpenWrt's Past and Future</strong><br>
  <em>Bradley M. Kuhn, Software Freedom Conservancy</em><br>
  The first SVN checkin to OpenWRT repository nearly 15 years ago was the release of source code that was released from BusyBox and Linux GPL enforcement efforts against Linksys and Cisco.  From its very beginning, OpenWRT has been intertwined with GPL enforcement, and that relationship should continue.<br><br>

Historically, more than any other industry, wireless device manufacturers have attempted to lock-down devices.  Some manufacturers now cooperate with the project, but recent disturbing trends in the FCC and elsewhere show clearly that such lock-down efforts will continue by some manufacturers to decrease hackability and increase control and lock-down. Linux's license, GPL, is the best defense we currently have against these efforts.<br><br>

This talk will present the current state of compliance problems seen in the wireless router space, discuss how GPL and its enforcement can be used as one tool among many to assure software freedom for all wireless router users, and how better cooperation between the OpenWRT community and current enforcement agents can make a big impact on the lock-down problems we currently face.
